In this test, a C program dictates specific actuation schedule for a few GPIO pins, of the form

32-bit PRU cycle time, 32-bit GPIO states
32-bit PRU cycle time, 32-bit GPIO states
...

In test ../01* I set up the DTO with these pins enabled:

r30.t0: P9_31
r30.t1: P9_29
r30.t2: P9_30
r30.t5: P9_27

The .p code can set and clear bits like r30.t1.
