This program has the PRU generate a 100kHz square wave by:
1. set pin P9_27 high
2. count from 500 to 0
3. set pin low
4. count from 500 to 0
5. repeat

The C code loads the PRU with these instructions and starts the PRU running.

You can verify this code w/ a oscilloscope, see pic taken Aug 22, 2016 on my iphone.

The PRU continues to generate the square wave even after the C code completes. It's not a problem to let the PRU contiune to run even while the main CPU is doing other stuff.
