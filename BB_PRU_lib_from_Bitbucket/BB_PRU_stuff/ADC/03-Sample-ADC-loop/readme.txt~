This program samples the ADC several times at a fixed interval.

TODO: I'm doing the subtraction in a screwy way that will cause some drift over time.
Need to figure out a better way to tell if it's time to sample agin.

sample output:

Hey, if you get a seg fault, make sure the EBB-PRU-Example device tree overlay has been loaded!!
